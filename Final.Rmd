Racial profiling with machine learning algorithms in police departments.

Machine learning algorithms looking at online data to show police high risk people and/or locations and targetting predominately lower income/minority neighborhoods.

What types of data do the algorithms look at?
What types of data lead to the algorithms targetting minorities?
How were the algorithms designed/set up?
Could the algorithms be adjusted to be less harmful to lower income communities?
How exactly have these algorithms changed policing? 

Try to adjust what data the algorithm looks at to make it less problematic.
